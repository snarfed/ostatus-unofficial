that don't implement it themselves, including Facebook, Twitter, and Google+.

TODO:

- add real atom support to activitystreams-unofficial. current one is really
  just XML rendering of the activitystreams REST API. todo: only return that on
  format=xml. for format=atom, follow example in evan_feed.atom, spec in
  http://activitystrea.ms/specs/atom/1.0/ , and add extra ostatus:conversation
  and ostatus:attention link rels as described in ostatus spec section 6.

- publish activitystreams atom feed for user with profile data, salmon endpoint,
  and push hub (section 11)

- send status updates to federated friends via salmon w/ostatus:attention
  - subscribe/unsubscribe with schema:follow and ostatus:unfollow
  - etc in spec section 10

- implement push server and send pings for events
